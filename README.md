# Vocabulary Book

Vocabulary Book is a simple React app that makes your language study much easier.  
It works by allowing you to easily add, edit and delete words and expressions for any number of languages.  

This app differs from other language apps in:
- Having been a English learner for 20 years, I know what a language learner would need especially in terms of building her vocabulary.  
  I just want an app that displays my custom words/expression clearly and has a text input for adding new word/expressions, another for the word/expression's definition and finally some space to add examples, for which I just cannot find one.
- It striped all those extra functionalities such as word/ definitions (you add it yourself), word classifications (beginner/intermediate/advanced) and quizes (you should remember your words/expressions more by examples and less by their definitions). So it is **really** slim.
- Its 100% free of charge.
- You can add as many languages as you want. No problem.
